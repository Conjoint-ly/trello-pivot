# Add pivot table functionality to Trello!

The pivot table functionality power-up was developed by the [Conjoint.ly](https://conjointly.com/?utm_campaign=trello-pivot-table&utm_medium=social&utm_source=trello-description) development team as a quick way to count to-do and completed cards, as well as tally total hours budgeted for cards.

Pivot tables are the perfect solution when you need to summarise and analyse large amounts of data. In just a few clicks, you can review project efficiency and productivity data in a simple display.

### üè∑Ô∏è Filtering
Using custom tags, each parameter can be modified with filters. Pick and choose which values you want to see and remove the rest. Want to look at completed or in-progress cards, but exclude pre-planning? A pivot table makes it simple.
